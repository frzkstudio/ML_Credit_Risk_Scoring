# Credit Risk Scoring ID/X Partners

This repository contains my project on predicting loan default risk using machine learning. The project focuses on assessing credit risk and developing a predictive model.

## Overview

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of loan default. The primary goal was to assist lending institutions in making informed decisions when evaluating loan applications. The project included the following steps:

- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Development
- Model Evaluation

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook files with code and analysis.
- `data/`: Data files used in the project.
- `images/`: Images and visualizations generated during analysis.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project is the LendingClub dataset, which contains historical data on loan applications, approved loans, and loan statuses.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Project Results

The machine learning model developed in this project achieved a predictive accuracy of X% on the test dataset. The project's findings are detailed in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Usage

You can explore the Jupyter Notebook in the `notebooks/` directory to understand the data analysis and modeling process.
